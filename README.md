# Telegram Bot on Node-RED

This repository contains **nodeRedPostgresTelegramBot**, built using Node-RED. The bot offers essential commands for managing contacts and their birthdays. Key features include user registration, adding contacts, viewing contacts and their birthdays, all of which are stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

The bot supports the following commands:

1. `/start` - start the bot and register the user in the database üöÄ
2. `/add [name] [YYYY-MM-DD]` - add a new contact's name and birthday ‚ûï
3. `/contacts` - view all contacts previously saved by the registered user üìí
4. `/contacts [name]` - find the birthday of a contact by name üéÇ"
5. `/delete` - permanently delete the registered user and all their contacts from the database ‚ùå

The bot's responses to commands are localized and adapt to the user's language settings (English, Russian, and Ukrainian).
